# AutoCar
Hi, this is my university project. Is very simple, but this connects react and express, and java connects to postgresql (this database is changed by react app and express and java) :D



***JAVA CLIENT***

You need to import libraries from ./lib

The  file that begin whole application is Login.java but 

If Login form make errors, to begin in /Main/Main.java



Java connects to postgresql database,  doesn't connect to express. (You can modify this for your purpose) :) 



***REACT NATIVE CLIENT***

App connects to express backend api (get cars and post solicitudes)



***EXPRESS BACKEND***

This connects to postgresql and makes API for autos and solicitudes.
